# rqt_joint_trajectory_controller working on hydro

As rqt_joint_trajectory_controller is not supported in ROS Hydro, this is a little repo that contains it and also controller_manager_msgs (which contains some utils that the rqt tool needs) so it can be used in Hydro.

It's based on the indigo branches of both packages.

No guarantees of it working for everyone given.
